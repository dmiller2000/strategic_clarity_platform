## Executive Summary

This project develops an NLP classifier to identify workplace power dynamics patterns in employee narratives, democratizing access to institutional knowledge typically available only to organizations and their legal/HR departments. By applying Jessica Cervi's proven NLP framework to workplace clarity, we create a strategic navigation system that addresses fundamental power asymmetries affecting 70% of employee engagement variance (Gallup Research).

## Research Question

**Can a fine-tuned NLP classifier accurately identify workplace power dynamics patterns from employee narratives and achieve >75% F1 score performance while providing explainable results using Jessica Cervi's text classification methodology?**

## Rationale

Workplace clarity (or lack of) and power dynamics create significant information asymmetries that disadvantage employees during challenging situations. Current solutions require expensive legal consultation or HR intervention, creating barriers for working professionals. This classifier provides pattern recognition capabilities to help employees navigate complex organizational behaviors strategically rather than reactively, democratizing access to institutional knowledge.
