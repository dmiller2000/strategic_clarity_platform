# AI-POWERED STRATEGIC CLARITY PLATFORM ("CLARITY ENGINE") 
Product Requirements Document (PRD)


PURPOSE
• Problem: Employees lack tools to identify workplace power dynamics patterns, creating information asymmetries
• Solution: NLP classifier to detect power patterns in workplace narratives
• Goal: Democratize access to institutional knowledge for employee empowerment

FEATURES
• Core Feature: Text classification of workplace narratives into power dynamic patterns
• Input: Employee-written workplace situation descriptions
• Output: Pattern classification with confidence scores
• Baseline Models: Naive Bayes + Decision Trees (Jessica's recommendations)
• Advanced Model: BERT fine-tuning

RELEASE CRITERIA
• Functional: F1 score > 0.75 for pattern classification
• Usability: Clear pattern explanations for non-technical users
• Reliability: Consistent performance across workplace scenarios
• Performance: Real-time classification capability
• Documentation: Professional-grade code and methodology documentation

TIMELINE
• Phase 1 (complete): Data collection, EDA, baseline models - 2 weeks
• Phase 2: BERT implementation, UI development - 4 weeks
• Next Actions: Production deployment consideration - TBD

STAKEHOLDERS
• Project Lead & Developer:  David Miller
• End Users: Working professionals experiencing workplace challenges

ASSUMPTIONS AND CONSTRAINTS
• Data Availability: 200+ workplace narratives achievable from Reddit/expert sources
• Technical Constraints: Academic environment limitations for deployment
• Ethical Constraints: Anonymization required for all narrative data
• Time Constraints: 6-week academic timeline for full development

USER STORIES AND USE CASES
• Primary User: "As an employee, I want to understand if my workplace situation follows known power dynamic patterns"
• Use Case 1: Employee inputs situation description, receives pattern classification
• Use Case 2: Professional seeks validation of workplace concerns through pattern recognition
• Use Case 3: Career strategist uses tool for client coaching and guidance

USER EXPERIENCE (UX) AND DESIGN
• Input Interface: Simple text box for narrative input
• Output Display: Pattern name, confidence score, brief explanation
• Design Philosophy: Clean, professional, non-intimidating interface
• Accessibility: Clear language avoiding technical jargon
• Visual Elements: TBD (Module 24 focus)

SUCCESS METRICS
• Technical KPI: F1 score > 0.75 (Jessica's requirement)
• Academic KPI: Professional-grade portfolio piece demonstrating NLP mastery
• Career KPI: Employer-impressive project showcasing innovation and technical skills
• User KPI: TBD (requires user testing in production)

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
• Preprocessing: Jessica C's NLP framework (tokenization, lemmatization, custom stop words)
• Algorithms: Naive Bayes (primary), Decision Trees (interpretability)
• Evaluation: Intrinsic/extrinsic evaluation framework
• Data Sources: Kaggle, Reddit r/antiwork, expert literature, Glassdoor reviews
• Pattern Categories: TBD (3-7 workplace power patterns based on data collection)

COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS
• Direct Competitors: None identified for workplace power pattern detection
• Adjacent Solutions: General workplace advice platforms, HR analytics tools
• Differentiation: AI-powered pattern recognition with academic rigor

RISK ASSESSMENT
• Technical Risk: F1 > 0.75 achievement with limited data
• Data Risk: Sufficient quality narrative collection
• Timeline Risk: Academic deadline constraints
• Ethical Risk: Sensitive workplace content handling

POST-LAUNCH CONSIDERATIONS
• Scalability: Production infrastructure requirements - TBD
• Maintenance: Model retraining and pattern evolution - TBD
• Legal: Privacy and workplace advice liability - TBD
• Monetization: Potential business model development - TBD
